	<p> During the 2022-2023 School Year I challenged myself by taking four weighted classes while also taking part of multiple extracurricular activities. This often resulted in a heavy workload with little amount of time to manage it all. However, through hard work and staying focused I now have the privilege to look back at my junior year as a success. Some of the highlights of my school year have been learning how to code in APCSP, understanding the pros and cons of the Gilded Age in AP US history, and debating the motives of Nurse from the novel One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest in English.</p>
